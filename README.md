Togo Programming Language
Togo is a small programming language I made during a weekend programming sprint. It supports fundamental programming concepts such as variable declaration, function calling, conditional statements, loops and more. The language syntax aims to be readable and intuitive, featuring colons to wrap function bodies, conditional statement bodies, and loop bodies, as well as a specific syntax for loops.
